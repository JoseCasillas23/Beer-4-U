Web design that is currently in progress, the only functionality working is the button to get your current location.
The stage where I am at is programing the webscrapping in Node.Js and trying to implement the Google Maps API to search for convenience stores near you and displays all the prices in the web page.
Another feature that I want to add is to make the web page responsive to different devices.
